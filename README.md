# SQL Advanced Data Analyst Project

##  Objective

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how SQL can be used for in-depth analysis, complex aggregations, and predictive insights from a retail data warehouse. This includes product performance forecasting, customer segmentation, trend analysis, and business intelligence metrics.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

The project queries data from multiple dimensions and fact tables stored in a schema titled `DataWarehouseAnalytics.gold`. Key tables involved include:

- `dim_customers` – Customer demographics and geography  
- `dim_products` – Product categories, subcategories, and costs  
- `fact_sales` – Transactional sales data  
- `dim_date` – Calendar dates for trend and seasonal analysis

---

## 🛠️ SQL Skills Demonstrated

- Schema exploration with multi-level joins  
- Aggregations: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `STDDEV`  
- Date/time analysis: using `DATEDIFF`, moving averages, seasonal trend grouping  
- Filtering and grouping: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`  
- Window functions: `RANK() OVER`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()/LEAD()`  
- Advanced analytics: cohort analysis, churn rate, and rolling metrics  
- CTEs and subqueries for modular query design  
- KPI dashboards through consolidated summary tables
